Stress Management App for University Students
This repository contains the design and development work for a Stress Management App aimed at helping university students relax by suggesting music based on their moods.

Project Overview:
This is an academic group project as part of the UI/UX course during my MSc in Information Systems at University College Dublin. 
The app is designed to provide a seamless user experience while recommending music tailored to the user's emotional state.

Major focus: 
Creating an intuitive interface with a user-centric design.

Key Features:
Mood-based music recommendations
User-friendly interface with smooth interactions
Focus on stress management for students

My Contributions:
Low-Fidelity Prototype: Developed the initial low-fi wireframes to lay the foundation for the app's interface and interactions.
Collaborated with the team to ensure a consistent transition to the high-fi prototype.

Prototypes:

High-fi: https://www.figma.com/proto/5fOWbC7DSnzEXTuqvnEFjr/Hi-FI-UXD?node-id=53-420&node-type=frame&t=CTmb8Q1GXQJ63ld8-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=33%3A175&starting-point-node-id=52%3A282

Team Details:
Academic Group Project
Collaborated with 4 peers to complete the design and prototyping process.

Future Scope:
Integration of machine learning algorithms to improve mood analysis.
Implementation as a fully functional mobile or web application.
